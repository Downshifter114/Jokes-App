# Jokes-App
I have created this app using a public api: "https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/", my goal was to practice on Retrofit, JSONs and Url manipulation. I tried to spend minimum time and effort on anything else then networking stuff and learnt how to make a get request, how to form accordingly for a JSON and how to manipulate a Url with buttons and user interactions.
