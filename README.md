# Jokes-App
An app that brings a joke to your screen according to the selections you make. You can select the language of a joke, category of a joke, setup type of a joke (Single joke or two-part) or flags (so you won't see jokes related to topics that you don't want to hear jokes about xD).

# Purpose
I only aimed for practice. The topics I wanted to practice are, Retrofit, JSONs, APIs, URL manipulation and combining these things with Dagger-Hilt. I tried to practice these topics in an isolated way, so I tried to spend as little effort as possible on other things.

# Features
- Kotlin
- Dagger-Hilt
- Jetpack Compose
- Retrofit
